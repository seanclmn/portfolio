        On his best walks, he was able to feel that he was nowhere. And this, finally, was all he ever asked of things:
        to

In adults, it is considered a highly specific radiogenomic signature for astrocytomas IDH-mutant, as opposed to other diffuse gliomas such as oligodendroglioma 4,5. Indeed, a 2021 meta-analysis showed a pooled specificity of 100% for identifying tumors with IDH-mutant, 1p19q non-codeleted status, though pooled sensitivity was 42% ">
